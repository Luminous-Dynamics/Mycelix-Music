## Executive Summary

Mycelix Music is a decentralized music streaming platform that revolutionizes how artists monetize their work by providing flexible economic models powered by smart contracts on the blockchain.

**The Problem:**
- Traditional streaming platforms pay artists $0.003-0.005 per stream
- Artists have no control over pricing or revenue models
- Centralized platforms extract 30-50% in fees
- Listeners have no direct connection to artists

**The Solution:**
- **Pay-Per-Stream:** Artists set their own price (recommended $0.01/stream = 3x traditional)
- **Gift Economy:** Free listening with community rewards and optional tipping
- **Custom Models:** Artists create their own economic strategies
- **Low Fees:** Smart contracts eliminate intermediaries
- **Transparency:** All transactions on-chain and verifiable
