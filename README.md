# 🎵 Mycelix Music: Decentralized Music Platform with Modular Economics

**Status:** ✅ Fully Functional - Ready to Run Locally
**Vision:** Every artist chooses their own economic operating system
**Innovation:** First music platform with truly pluggable payment models
**Lines of Code:** 3,555 lines across 24 files + 37K words documentation

---

## 🌟 The Revolutionary Concept

Traditional music platforms force ONE economic model on ALL artists:
- Spotify: $0.003 per stream, pooled royalties, 90-day payout delay
- Bandcamp: 15% fee, direct sales only
- Patreon: Subscription-only, no per-song monetization

**Mycelix Music is different:**
> Each artist/DAO can compose their own economic model from pluggable primitives.

### Real-World Example

**DJ Nova** (electronic artist):
- **Model:** Gift Economy
- **Listening:** FREE
- **Monetization:** Optional tips + listener rewards with CGC tokens
- **Why:** Building community first, monetize later

**The Echoes** (indie rock band):
- **Model:** Pay Per Stream
- **Listening:** $0.01 per play (10x Spotify!)
- **Monetization:** Instant split to 4 band members + producer
- **Why:** Established fanbase, want immediate revenue

**Symphony Orchestra**:
- **Model:** Patronage
- **Listening:** $20/month unlimited
- **Monetization:** Split among 50 musicians + conductor
- **Why:** High-quality recordings, dedicated classical audience

**All three use THE SAME PLATFORM.** This is the power of economic modularity.

## 🎯 Quick Start

### For Developers: Run Locally (30 Minutes)

**Follow the complete guide:** [**QUICKSTART.md**](./QUICKSTART.md)

#### Option A: Nix Development Shell (recommended)

If you're on NixOS (or have Nix installed) the repo already provides a flake:

```bash
# 0. Drop into the dev shell (installs Node 20, npm, git, TypeScript tooling, etc.)
nix develop

# 1. Install JavaScript dependencies inside the shell
npm install

# 2. Continue with the steps below (anvil, deploy, services, etc.)
```

The shell works on any system supported by `nixos-unstable`, so teammates get identical toolchains without touching global Node installs.

#### Option B: Manual setup (Node/npm on host)

> **Note:** Contract scripts (`npm run contracts:*`, `forge fmt`, etc.) require [Foundry](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation). If Foundry isn't installed the contract lint step simply logs a warning and continues.

```bash
# 1. Navigate to project
cd /srv/luminous-dynamics/04-infinite-play/core/mycelix-music

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Set up environment
cp .env.example .env

# 4. Start blockchain (Terminal 1)
anvil --block-time 1

# 5. Deploy contracts (Terminal 2)
npm run contracts:deploy:local

# 6. Start services (Terminal 3)
npm run services:up

# 7. Seed test data
npm run seed:local

# 8. Start frontend
cd apps/web && npm run dev

# 9. Visit http://localhost:3000 🎉
```

**What you'll see:**
- 3 test artists with different economic models
- 10 test songs ready to stream
- Full upload wizard
- Working payment flows
- Beautiful UI

**Detailed instructions, troubleshooting, and verification:** See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)

### Developer Workflows & Quality Gates

- `npm run lint` &mdash; runs Turbo-powered linting across API, SDK, frontend, and contract packages. If Foundry (`forge`) isn’t installed, the contracts lint step logs `[contracts] forge not found; skipping lint`.
- `npm run lint --workspace=<pkg>` &mdash; lint an individual workspace (e.g., `apps/api`, `packages/sdk`, `apps/web`) when iterating locally.
- `npm run test --workspace=packages/sdk` &mdash; runs the Jest suite for the TypeScript SDK (watchman disabled via local Jest config, safe for sandboxed CI).
- `nix flake check` &mdash; once run outside sandboxed environments, this executes the flake-defined checks; for now the dev shell (`nix develop`) is the primary Nix entrypoint.

### For Artists: Upload Your First Song

1. **Visit** https://mycelix.music (coming soon)
2. **Connect Wallet** (we'll create one for you!)
3. **Upload Song** (FLAC, MP3, or WAV)
4. **Choose Economics:**
   - Independent Artist (pay-per-stream)
   - Community Collective (gift economy)
   - Custom (build your own)
5. **Set Revenue Splits** (you + collaborators)
6. **Deploy** (one click, ~$0.50 gas fee)
7. **Share Link** with your fans!

## 🏗️ Architecture Highlights

### 1. Smart Contract Router Pattern

```solidity
// Each song points to a strategy contract
songStrategy[songId] => PayPerStreamStrategy
                     OR GiftEconomyStrategy
                     OR PatronageStrategy
                     OR CustomStrategy

// When listener pays:
router.processPayment(songId, amount)
  → delegates to strategy.processPayment()
  → strategy handles distribution
  → instant payment to all recipients
```

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Add new strategies without changing core
- ✅ Artists can switch strategies anytime
- ✅ Each song can have different economics
- ✅ Fully on-chain and auditable

### 2. TypeScript SDK Abstraction

```typescript
import { EconomicStrategySDK } from '@mycelix/sdk';

// Artist registers song
await sdk.registerSong('my-song-id', {
  strategyId: 'pay-per-stream-v1',
  paymentModel: PaymentModel.PAY_PER_STREAM,
  distributionSplits: [
    { recipient: artistAddress, basisPoints: 9500, role: 'artist' },
    { recipient: protocolAddress, basisPoints: 500, role: 'protocol' }
  ],
  minimumPayment: 0.01,
});

// Listener streams song
await sdk.streamSong('my-song-id', '0.01');

// Artist gets paid INSTANTLY ⚡
```

### 3. React UI Wizard

```tsx
<EconomicStrategyWizard songId="my-song" />
```

**Result:** Beautiful 5-step wizard that guides artists through:
1. Choose preset or custom model
2. Configure payment model
3. Set revenue splits
4. Add listener incentives
5. Review & deploy

## 📊 Implemented Economic Models

### Model 1: Pay Per Stream ✅

**How it works:**
- Listener pays $0.01 FLOW per play
- Payment instantly splits per artist's configuration
- No pooling, no delays

**Smart contract:** `PayPerStreamStrategy.sol`
**Use case:** Artists with established fanbase

### Model 2: Gift Economy ✅

**How it works:**
- Listening is FREE
- Listeners earn CGC tokens for listening (!)
- Optional voluntary tips to artist
- Early listener bonuses (first 100 get 10 CGC)
- Repeat listener bonuses (1.5x multiplier)

**Smart contract:** `GiftEconomyStrategy.sol`
**Use case:** Community-building, experimental music

### Model 3+: Coming Soon 🔮

- **Patronage:** Monthly subscription for unlimited listening
- **NFT-Gated:** Own NFT to access exclusive tracks
- **Pay What You Want:** Listener chooses amount
- **Auction:** Dutch auction for limited releases
- **Time Barter:** Trade TEND tokens for access

**The beauty:** New models can be added without changing core platform!

## 🎤 The Vision

Music is the most universal form of human expression. Yet the industry that distributes it is broken:
- Artists earn pennies while platforms extract billions
- Listeners have no say in how artists are paid
- One economic model forced on everyone from classical to punk

**We're building something different:**

> A platform where every artist is sovereign, every listener is valued, and every community can design its own economy.

This is not just a music platform. It's an experiment in **economic pluralism**. It's proof that decentralization can be BETTER than centralization, not just more idealistic.

If we succeed, we won't just change music. We'll show that the future of the internet is not a few giant platforms, but millions of interconnected communities, each with their own values and economics.

**That's worth building.** 🚀
